<p>
Greetings,
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your willingness to provide a Slackware mirror.  In order to
make the experience as nice as possible for everyone involved (you, us, and
our users), here's what we need from you:
</p>

<ol>

	<li> http address of your mirror</li>

		<ul>
			<br>

			<li> we've not required http access before, but that's 
				what mirrorbrain uses (and frankly, it is more 
				popular than ftp these days), so we'll need an 
				http link.</li>
			<li> https is fine too, and many users prefer it these
				days, but make sure it's configured correctly!
				</li>
		</ul>

	<br>

	<li> ftp address of your mirror</li>

		<ul>
			<br>

			<li>if you'd prefer to not provide an ftp mirror, that's
				okay - just put "none" for this</li>
		</ul>

	<br>

	<li>rsync address of your mirror</li>

		<ul>

			<br>

			<li>mirrorbrain will periodically scan the file tree 
				exposed via rsync and use that information to 
				determine if a) your mirror is online, and b) 
				if your mirror actually has the file that a 
				user has requested, and if both a) and b) are 
				true, then users can be redirected to your mirror.</li>

			<br>

			<li>If you do not want the general public accessing 
				your rsync server, then you need to whitelist 
				this ip address block (<tt>207.223.116.208/29</tt> - connections may come from <tt>.211</tt> or <tt>.213</tt>) via
				iptables or some such.  Please note that the
				rsync url *will* be published, so any restrictions 
				to the general public will have to be on your end.</li>
		</ul>

	<br>

	<li>an email address that we can use to contact you</li>

		<ul>

			<br>

			<li>an alias like "<tt>mirror@</tt>" or "<tt>ftp@</tt>" is better than 
				a single person's address; people tend to 
				leave for new employment, die, and so on, and 
				then we get bounce messages for nonexistent 
				addresses...   A
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">
				bus number</a> greater than 1 is better ;-)
		</li></ul>
 
	<br>

</ol>

<p>
The previous mirrors admin had some sort of hierarchy worked out with 
respect to which mirrors were considered "primary" (and thus were okay
for other mirrors to use for syncing), but I have been unable to find
any documentation of that hierarchy.  Therefore, this is the best I can
do at the moment: You can use our primary mirror <tt>rsync://ftp.slackware.com/slackware/</tt> 
(which is actually OSUOSL), but the ISO images aren't present there
(and this is not something within my control), so here are some good
options to use as your upstream (but check the <a href="https://mirrors.slackware.com/mirrorlist/">Mirror List</a> 
for some other potential options): <br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>rsync://mirrors.kernel.org/slackware/ (US) </tt> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>rsync://mirror.slackbuilds.org/slackware/ (US) </tt> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>rsync://slackware.cs.utah.edu/slackware/ (US) </tt> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>rsync://rsync.lug.udel.edu/slackware/ (US) </tt> <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>rsync://slackware.uk/slackware/ (UK) </tt> <br>
</p>

<p>
Your mirror should use the same base directory structure:  http://yourmirror.org/slackware/... 
e.g. if you want to mirror everything we have, then you'd do this: 
<br>
<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>rsync -havP \<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --delete --delete-after \<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --no-o --no-g --safe-links \<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --timeout=60 --contimeout=30 \ <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rsync://your-upstream-mirror/slackware/ \<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /your-toplevel-pub/slackware/</tt>
</p>

<p>
If you don't want to mirror the entire tree (a full tree with all publicly
available previous versions of Slackware is ~200GB), then you can use rsync's 
"<tt>--exclude</tt>" option to exclude some parts.  As an example, if you do 
not want the <tt>/slackware/slackware-3.0/</tt> directory mirrored, you 
would use this as an argument to rsync:  
<br>
<br>
  "<tt>--exclude "slackware-3.0/"</tt>"
<br>
<br>
The <tt>--exclude</tt> argument can be used multiple times, or you can put excludes in 
a file and then use that file as the argument - see <tt>rsync(1)</tt> for more info.
</p>

<p>
We do ask that you mirror at least the latest stable release (both 32 and 
64 bit arch) and the -current development tree (both 32 and 64 bit arch).
</p>

<p>
We also ask that you not place anything else inside the top slackware/
directory (e.g. unofficial package sets, slackbuilds.org scripts, and other 
things not on <tt>mirrors.slackware.com</tt> - this creates confusion about 
what is ours and what isn't.
</p>

<p>
If your webserver is running apache httpd, consider including both 
<tt>NameWidth=*</tt> and <tt>DescriptionWidth=*</tt> in <tt>IndexOptions</tt>.
You'll probably also want something along these lines:
</p><pre>        AddType text/plain .sh
        AddType text/plain .diff
        AddType text/plain .meta
        AddType text/plain .sign
        AddType text/plain .asc
        AddType text/plain .md5

        &lt;Files *.tgz.asc&gt;
            RemoveEncoding .tgz
        &lt;/Files&gt;
        
        &lt;Files *.tgz.md5&gt;
            RemoveEncoding .tgz
        &lt;/Files&gt;
</pre>
<p></p>
